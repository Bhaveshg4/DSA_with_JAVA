public class IntroLinkedList {
    
}
//ArrayList: array like structure
// LinkedList: non contigaous data structure
// 1 -------> 2 -----------> 3 ------------> Null
//use linked list when you have to insert the elememts in middle as time complexity of insertion in 
//linkedlist is O(1) as compared to insert operation of ArrayList which is O(n)
//Similarly, the search operation time complexity of ArrayList is O(1) and LinkedList is O(n) which is fasster
// than ArrayList. In terms of addition operation, use LinkedList.

//Basic properties of LinkedList:
/*
 * Variable size
 * Non contiguous Memory
 * Insert in O(1)
 * Insert in O(n)
 * Basic structure of linked list: Node: |Data | Next pointer of next node element|
 * // 1 -------> 2 -----------> 3 ------------> Null
