    //INTRODUCTION AND PROPERTIES
    //time complexity if we find a element in normal tree = O(n), where n is nodes
    //time complexity of binary search tree = O(h) where h is height of tree
    ///Binary Search tree properties:
    //atmax two nodes
    //in BST, left subtree nodes are always < root
    //right elements are always greater than root
    // left and right subtrees  are also BST with no duplicates
    //Special property of BST: inorder traversal of BST gives a sorted sequence
    //building a BST is simple as building a normal tree, just you have to keep in mind top 5th and 6th point
