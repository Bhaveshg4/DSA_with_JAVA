     * Time complexity: Add: O(1), Remove: O(1), Peek: O(1)
     * A circular queue is an extended version of a linear queue as it follows the First In First Out principle with the exception that it connects
     *  the last node of a queue to its first by forming a circular link.
     * Rear = (rear+1)%(size) --------> Very important statement.
     * for circular queue if (Rear+1)%size = front and for linear queue (rear+1)=front, the queue is full
